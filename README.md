# Leads Tracker Chrome Extension

Get it:
<ul>
<li> for Chrome</li>
<li> for Firefox and Edge (not available yet)</li>
</ul>

## Explanation
This is a tiny but pretty cool chrome extension that does a couple of things:

<ul>
<li>keeps track of all the websites that you want to go back to on chrome by storing their links</li>
<li>Saves those websites. So its kind of like a bookmarking extension for those webpages and sites that you want to re-visit in the future</li>
</ul>

## How it works
This is pretty easy to do

<ul>
<li>Fork the repository and get it on your local device</li>
<li>Open up Chrome extensions, turn on developer mode and load the extension</li>
<li>Hurray! You now can track your links with the Leads Tracker</li>
 </ul>

## Visual How it Works
<ul>
 <li>To save the link on the current site you are on click press 'save tab'<li>
</ul>
<img src = "images/save tab.jpg">


<ul>
<li>To copy a link outside of the current site you are on copy and paste it into the bar and click 'save input'<li>
</ul>
<img src = "images/save input.jpg">

<ul>
<li>To delete all your links DOUBLE CLICK 'delete all'<li>
</ul>
<img src = "images/delete all.jpg">
